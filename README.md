## Puzzles
In main.py, I have commented out some starting code for these puzzles. <br />
Write your code in these sections and uncomment them. <br />
I have provided some examples of similar functions to what each puzzle is asking for. Learn to read the code and modify it. <br />

At the very bottom, I have listed the functions. Comment and uncomment them, to run them one at a time.

```
# Run the puzzles

    example_a()
    # puzzle_a()

    example_b()
    # puzzle_b()

    example_c()
    # puzzle_c()
```

### A - What's your name, baby?
Write a program that asks "What's your first name, baby?". <br />
Have the program also ask for your second name. <br />
Use string.Join() to create the final sentence "Your full name is {firstName} {secondName}"<br />
Use multiple string.Joins to create the final sentence "Name: {secondName}, {firstName}" <br />
Remember to have spaces between the strings when you join them. <br />


### B - You are replaceable
Write a program that asks the user to "Input a sentence with the word "and" in it: ". <br />
Replace every occurence of the word "and" with the symbol & <br />
Remember to escape the backslashes around "and" or use raw string.<br />


### C â€“ Choose a word to replace
Write a program that asks the user "Please enter a sentence: "<br />
Then ask the user "Which word will we replace?: " <br />
Then ask the user "Replace it with what?: " <br />
Output the original sentence with the word replaced. <br />
Don't worry if the user enters a word that is not in the sentence, we have not covered loops or error catching yet. <br />
Just to be clear, the program WILL crash if the user enters a word not in the sentence. That's ok for now. <br />


# Good Luck!
